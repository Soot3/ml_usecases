The probability of loan defaults, and the liabilities that come with its occurence, is one of the biggest challanges lending financial institutions face. While most defaults occur unexepectedly, the more information financial institutions have on their customers, the more accurate their risk assessment is. However, this underscores a Big Data problem, with traditional assessment techniques failing to accurately account for the large volume of highly dimensional data available.

This project looks at building and deploying Machine Learning solutions to assess risk and predict loan defaults.
